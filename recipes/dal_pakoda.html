    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dal pakoda, also known as lentil fritters, is a popular Indian snack made by deep-frying spiced and seasoned lentil batter. It's a delightful and crispy treat that can be enjoyed with chutneys or sauces. The primary ingredient for making dal pakoda is usually chana dal (split chickpeas), though variations may include other lentils like moong dal (split green gram).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chana Dal: The main ingredient, soaked for a few hours to soften.</li>
        <li>Onion: Finely chopped for flavor and texture.</li>
        <li>Green Chillies: Finely chopped for spiciness.</li>
        <li>Ginger: Grated or finely chopped for a zesty flavor</li>
        <li>Coriander Leaves: Chopped for freshness and color.</li>
        <li>Spices: Common spices include cumin seeds, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Baking Soda: Sometimes added to make the pakodas fluffy.</li>
        <li>Oil: For deep frying.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Soaking: Chana dal is soaked for a few hours to soften it, making it easier to grind.</li>
        <li>Grinding: The soaked chana dal is ground into a coarse paste without adding too much water. The texture should be somewhat grainy.</li>
        <li>Mixing: To the ground dal, chopped onions, green chillies, ginger, coriander leaves, and spices are added. The mixture is thoroughly combined to ensure even distribution of flavors.</li>
        <li>Frying: Oil is heated in a deep frying pan. Small portions of the dal mixture are dropped into the hot oil using a spoon or hand, forming small fritters. They are deep-fried until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Draining Excess Oil: Once fried, the pakodas are taken out of the oil and placed on absorbent paper to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serving: Dal pakodas are typically served hot and can be accompanied by various chutneys like mint chutney, tamarind chutney, or yogurt-based sauces. They are also sometimes served with a cup of tea as a popular evening snack.</li>
