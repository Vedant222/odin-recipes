    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Dosa is a popular and versatile South Indian dish that has gained widespread popularity not only in India but also internationally. It is a thin, crispy pancake made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram). The batter is traditionally fermented overnight, which gives dosa its characteristic tangy flavor.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>  Rice: Typically, a combination of parboiled rice and regular rice is used          </li>
        <li>Urad Dal: Also known as black gram, it adds a rich and creamy texture to the batter. </li>
        <li>Fenugreek seeds: These are often included in the batter to aid in fermentation and add flavor. </li>
        <li>Salt: For seasoning.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Soaking: The rice and urad dal are soaked separately, usually for a few hours. Fenugreek seeds are often added to the urad dal during soaking.</li>
        <li>Grinding: After soaking, the rice and urad dal are ground to a smooth batter consistency separately. Some water is added during the grinding process.</li>
        <li>Mixing: The rice and urad dal batters are then mixed together, and salt is added. The batter is left to ferment overnight or for several hours. Fermentation is a crucial step as it contributes to the characteristic flavor and texture of dosa.</li>
        <li>Making the Dosa: To make dosa, a ladleful of the fermented batter is spread thinly on a hot griddle or flat pan. It is typically cooked with a bit of oil or ghee until it becomes golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Varieties: While the classic dosa is plain, there are numerous variations. Masala dosa is a popular type filled with a spiced potato mixture. Other variations include onion dosa, cheese dosa, and more.</li>
        <li>Serving: Dosas are often served with coconut chutney and sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew). They can also be accompanied by various types of chutneys and pickles.</li>
